# maternal_metabolome_birthweight

## Overview

```
Script for the main and sensitivity analysis of the impact of maternal metabolites on foetal birthweight.
Approach 1 - UKBB selected SNPs; approach 2 - Kettunen selected SNPs; 3 - SNPs selected from multiple independent 
GWAS
```

## 1. Main analysis

```
Produces the UVMR estimates,the top 10 best individual models and marginal inclusion probabilities
and model-averaged effect (MACE) for each risk factor.
 
```
## 2. Plots

```
Creates the grouped UVMR forest plot, heatmaps for all approaches and a plot demonstrating SNP overlap 
for specific metabolites.
```

## 3. Sensitivity analysis

```
Contains the code to calculate F-statistics, analyses excluding influential SNPs, analyses excluding influential 
metabolites and analyses determining model sensitivity to Bayesian parameters.
